#Abstract:

Sentiment analysis for low-resource languages like Bangla presents a significant challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of specialized datasets and the linguistic nuances of colloquial text. To address this, this study proposes a novel three-layer stacking ensemble underpinned by a synergistic hybrid feature architecture. This core innovation fuses deep contextual embeddings from advanced neural models, including M-BERT and Bi-LSTM, with classical statistical term-importance scores from TF-IDF, creating a uniquely rich feature representation. The effectiveness of our proposed model is verified on DramaSent-BD, a new purpose-built collection of 45,721 annotated user comments from the Bangla drama forum, which we also present as a contribution to the research community. The proposed architecture achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 97.40%, establishing a new performance benchmark by significantly outperforming both standalone models and a non-hybrid stacking baseline. This work thus presents a dual contribution: a highly effective and interpretable model for Bangla sentiment analysis and a valuable public dataset to facilitate future research.
